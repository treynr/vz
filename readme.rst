Some cool name
==============

Some cool name is a reusable visualization and charting library built on top of D3_.
The library currently supports XX different chart types and exposes a chaining-based API
similar to the one used by D3.
Almost all stylistic aspects of each chart can be modified using the primary API;
those that can't can be easily changed using D3 selections.
