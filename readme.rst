==

``vz`` is a reusable visualization and charting library built on top of `D3.js`__.
The library currently supports XX different chart types and exposes a 
chaining-based API similar to the one used by D3.
Almost all stylistic aspects of each chart can be modified using the primary API;
those that can't can be easily changed using D3 selections.
